The Usable & Effective Firmware Initiative strives to connect practitioners
in the field of firmware development, build a forum to discuss the state of
the art, improve on it, and define standards in an open environment.

Natural persons are welcome to join. This is not a trade organization and
it will never become one, The U&EFI focuses on connecting professionals not
power hungry managers.

We gladly accept donations (to the Software Freedom Conservancy which we're not
affiliated with but who are doing good work) but this isn't pay-to-play. If
you're seeking that, check out the UEFI Forum which, despite the confusingly
similar name, is not affiliated with us, and never will be since we're only
accepting natural persons.

Specifications will be made open: No "look but don't touch", no pay-to-play,
no certification or similar nonsense. If you're seeking that, check out the
UEFI Forum which, despite the confusingly similar name, is not affiliated
with us, and never will be since we're only accepting natural persons.
